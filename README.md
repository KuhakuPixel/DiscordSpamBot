# DiscordSpamBot

This is a group project for university assingment
where we create discord bot to detect spam

## Dataset
all data are in [data folder](./data/)

For training we used data from 
[UCI's SMS Spam Collection Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection)
which we have put in this repo [here](./data/spam.csv)

for testing the model against real discord messages, we have created
our own custom dataset [here](./data/discord.csv)

## Model

the ML model is created from file `./RMCS_NLP_PROJECT.ipynb`
which we modify to fit our need from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/faressayah/natural-language-processing-nlp-for-beginners)

the model is exported into  `./nb_model.joblib` and `./vect.joblib`


## Installing
Clone this repo,
go to the directory, and run

```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

## Running

[this website](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html)
will tell you how to create your own discord bot account and get the token

```
python bot.py <YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN>
```
### choosing model to use
(default is naive bayes)
```
python bot.py <YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN> --model naiveBayes
```

```
python bot.py <YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN> --model randomForest
```
